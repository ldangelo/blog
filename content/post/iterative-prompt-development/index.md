![Iterative Prompt Development](https://www.cps.edu/contentassets/c9c5e83a44284b1ebbcf62835166d162/iterating-01.png)

## Overview

The better the prompt the better the outcome. Most AI projects go
sideways because little to no effort is put into developing a more
effective prompt. The more you can tell the AI about the problem
the higher the success rate will be. This is called prompt development.

## Use Claude to help you iterate on your prompts

Start with a simple prompt and iterate on it. The more you can tell
Claude with each step the better the outcome will be. Start simple
with business requirements and expand from there.

### A simple starting point

I recently started a project by defining the business requirements,
adding references to external API's and defining what success looks like.
I then asked Claude to create a component diagram and class diagram based
on the provided information.

### Create some high level diagrams

I iterated on the diagrams using Claude until I was satisfied. I then
referenced these diagrams that Claude helped me create and re-read the
prompt. I then asked Claude to write a prompt based on the diagrams.

### Add Technical Requirements

I added in technical requirements like language, database, architectural
principals, etc.. I re-read the prompt and asked Claude to update the prompt.

### Create an executive summary

I then asked Claude to create an executive summary. Iterated with Claude
on the summary until I was satisfied. I then added the summary to the prompt.
Re-read the prompt and asked Claude to update the prompt.

### Create a product requirements document

I then asked Claude to create a detailed product requirements document.  
Iterated with Claude until I was satisfied. I then added the requirements
to the prompt file and asked Claude to update the prompt.

### Improve your prompt

I then asked Claude how I could improve the prompt and iterated on it's
suggestions.

## Outcome

The resulting prompt was much more detailed and informative than anything
I could have come up with on my own. You can continue this process until
Claude starts giving suggestions that provide little to no value.
