# Leo D'Angelo

Leo D’Angelo is a partner in the Central practice of Fortium Partners. He adds 25 years of technology leadership experience to Fortium, most of which include developing and delivering SaaS solutions. D’Angelo is a driving force behind software development that has transformed systems architecture in the technology, finance and non-profit sectors. He has delivered solutions via private data centers, hosting providers, AWS and Docker, and he also developed green field SaaS applications. He has a history of rescuing troubled IT systems and shepherding technology departments through the acquisition process, having been an executive team member for acquired and acquiring organizations.

Prior to joining Fortium, D’Angelo served for 10 years as the CTO of Orange Leap (acquired by YourCause, LLC), an ERP software provider that helps nonprofits manage donors. As CTO, D’Angelo transitioned the company from a services-based model to one focused on open source SaaS product development. He led the fundraising, design and deployment for their cutting-edge solution, and after the acquisition, he was responsible for managing the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and overall product architecture. 

Before Orange Leap, D’Angelo was CTO and chief security officer at j2 Global Communications, where he was the lead system architect, responsible for overseeing and strengthening the company’s network infrastructure and application environment, including systems for payment processing, billing and customer service. D’Angelo’s renovated architecture produced impressive gains in service quality while simultaneously reducing operating costs. 

As founder and CTO of TimeShift, D’Angelo designed and implemented a state-of-the-art architecture known as the Communications Commerce (C-Commerce) network. In addition to technical work, he managed staffing for all technology and operations staff, and, on the development side, helped the company raise $10 million for its eventual sale. 

Early in his career, D’Angelo designed an innovative equity trading floor known as FIX (Financial Interface Exchange Protocol) as a software consultant for Fidelity Investments. FIX, which handles buy-side to sell-side communications digitally, reduced costly latencies inherent in the old mainframe-based trading infrastructure. It became the industry standard and remains so to this day.
